I have implemented two classes: Customer.java, which manages all customer details, and an inner class Loan within Customer.java to handle loan details specific to each customer. Additionally, 
the CustomerService class includes the functionality for processing loan applications

1:Customer.java: Manages customer details.
2:Inner class Loan: Handles loan details specific to the customer.
3:CustomerService: Processes loan applications.
